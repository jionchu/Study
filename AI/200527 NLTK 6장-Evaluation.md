# Evaluation

## 1. Precision & Recall
- **Precision**: which indicates how many of the items that we idnentified were relevant, is **TP/(TP+FP)**
- **Recall**: which indicates how many of the relevant items that we identified, is **TP/(TP+FN)**
- **F-Measure** (or F-Score): which combines the precision and recall to give a single score, is defined to be the harmonic mean of the precision and recall **(2 X Precision X Recall)/(Precision+Recall)**
